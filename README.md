# Big-O-Notation-
In this program I was tasked to make the method "generalClockProblem" run in less then 2 mins. The other code was provided to me and I could not change it. the method "generalClockProblem" takes in a list and a integer the method is used to find and print the 2 indeces in which the consecutive numbers add up to 2*10^integer.the lengths of the lists where ranged from 10 to 1 million and they contained random integers inside them. this code made the method run under 24 seconds.
